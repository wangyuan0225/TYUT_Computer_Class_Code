  * @Brief          : Compute the shortest path lengths from a given positive weight
  *                     directed graph. The graph contains n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1,
  *                     with vertex 0 as the source.
  * @Attention      : Input format:
  *                     The first line of input contains two positive integers n and e,
  *                     representing the number of vertices and edges of the graph, where n
  *                     does not exceed 20000 and e does not exceed 1000. The next e lines
  *                     represent the information of each edge, each line contains 3
  *                     non-negative integers a, b, and c, where a and b represent the
  *                     endpoint numbers of the edge, and c represents the weight. The edges
  *                     are not sorted in order of endpoint numbers.
  *                   Output format:
  *                     Output a line of integers, representing the shortest path lengths
  *                     from the source vertex 0 to each vertex in the order of vertex
  *                     numbers (excluding the distance from the source vertex to itself).
  *                     If there is no shortest path from the source vertex to a certain
  *                     vertex, do not output the distance for that path.
  * @Date           : 2023-12-02  09:38
  * @Version        : 2.0 Optimized the use of arrays
  *                   3.0 Optimized the algorithm using priority queue
  *                   4.0 Cancel the use of priority queues for implementation
